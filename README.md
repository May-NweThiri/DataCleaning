# DataCleaning

This repository contains a collection of data cleaning methods implemented in Python. Data cleaning is an essential step in the data preprocessing phase, aiming to improve the quality of the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data, and more.


## Introduction

Data cleaning is a critical aspect of preparing datasets for analysis or machine learning models. This repository houses various data cleaning methods that address different issues commonly encountered in datasets, such as missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.

## Methods

The methods implemented in this project include:

- Handling missing values using imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode.
- Removing duplicate rows based on specific columns or the entire row.
- Standardizing data by scaling or normalizing numerical features.
- Handling outliers through various statistical techniques.

Each method is implemented as a separate module, providing a clear structure for individual data cleaning operations.
